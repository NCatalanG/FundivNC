#' Converts length measures to body mass for bees and Carabids
#' 
#' For Bees, the conversion is done as per Cane et al. 1987 (Estimation of bee 
#' size using intertegular span (Apoidea). Journal of the Kansas Entomological 
#' Society 60:145â€“147). The correlation between IT and body mass is 0.96.
#' For Carabids the conversion is done from Jelaska et al. 2011 (Carabid beetle 
#' diversity and mean individual biomass in beech forests of various ages. 
#' ZooKeys 100:393-405) which in turn is based on Szyszko J (1983) book.

#' or carabid beetles body length (mm)\code{}
#'
#' @return A vector of bee body masses is returned in gr for bees and (mg) for Carabids.
